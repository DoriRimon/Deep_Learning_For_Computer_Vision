# Deep_Learning_For_Computer_Vision
This repository is my solution to the homeworks given in the MICHIGAN EECS 498.008 / 598.008 - Deep Learning for Computer Vision course.   

The homework included in the repo:
1. PyTorch101 & KNN (k-nearest neighbors)
2. Linear Classifier (SVM loss, SoftMax loss) & Two-Layer NN


# Some Results
<p>
The learned weights for each class of the CIFAR10 dataset, using an SVM liner classifier
